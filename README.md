A customer order report generator for sales of tickets to house tours
using data from the Ecwid shopping cart via their API.

This is a very specialized app written to deal with the lack of decent
sales reporting in the shopping cart system that we've been using to
sell tours of our historic Pittsburgh neighborhood.

It's also been a vehicle for me to learn to code Django apps which I'd
been meaning to do for some time. As this is MY FIRST DJANGO APP, it's
not exactly the best written thing ever and could use quite a bit of
refactoring and optimization but that will probably never happen since
we're probably going to move to a different system for next year.
